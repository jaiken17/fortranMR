# fortranMR
Fortran library for reading output files generated by [MESA](https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa) (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics). Extends [fortranDF](https://github.com/jaiken17/fortranDF) to read in files as Fortran data frame.

Currently this repo is quite barebones -> it will be updated.
